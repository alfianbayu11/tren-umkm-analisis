## Application Description
This application aims to analyze the trends in the number of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in the province of West Java for the period 2016-2023. Utilizing projection data published by the Department of Cooperatives and SMEs of West Java Province, this application provides visualizations and modeling using linear regression analysis.

## Key Features

2. **Interactive Visualization:** Users can choose the desired type of visualization, including Line Chart, Bar Chart, or Pie Chart. These visualizations provide a clear overview of the trends in the number of SMEs in each District/City during a specific period.

3. **Linear Regression Analysis:** The application provides linear regression analysis for the selected District/City. Regression coefficients, intercepts, and the accuracy of the model (R-squared) are displayed. Additionally, users can see predictions for the number of SMEs for the next year based on the regression model.

## How to Use

## Data Reference
The data on the projection of the number of SMEs in West Java is sourced from the Department of Cooperatives and SMEs of West Java Province.

## Notes
1. Linear regression analysis provides estimates based on historical trends and depends on certain assumptions.
2. The data used only covers the number of SMEs at the district/city level, so the results of the analysis do not reflect the entire complexity of SME trends in West Java.
